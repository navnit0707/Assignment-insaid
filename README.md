## Design and Development

This website serves as a prototype, demonstrating how any organization can establish an online presence. One of the key challenges of online platforms is making a positive impression on visitors, given the limited opportunity to engage them.

To address this, the website features a sleek and simple user interface (UI). Considering that many users access websites from mobile devices, a mobile-first approach was adopted, ensuring cross-compatibility across different devices. CSS was used extensively to achieve these objectives.
